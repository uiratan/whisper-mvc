# PROJECT STATE: Whisper Test

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14 | **Current Phase:** Pending | **Overall Progress:** 0%

---

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Upload de um arquivo de áudio e ver a transcrição com timestamps funcionando na tela.

**What We're Building:** A simple Next.js web app that lets users upload audio files, transcribes them locally using whisper.cpp, and displays results with timestamps. Proof of concept to validate frontend-whisper.cpp integration.

**Current Focus:** Awaiting approval to begin Phase 1 (Frontend & Upload)

---

## Current Position

**Roadmap Status:** Draft complete, awaiting user approval

**Phase:** Not started

**Plan:** None yet (waiting for phase approval)

**Progress:** 0% (roadmap ready for planning)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Requirements Mapped | 7/7 | 7/7 ✓ |
| Phases Created | 2 | 2-3 |
| Success Criteria Defined | 9 | 2+ per phase |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Phase Count:** 2 phases for quick delivery (quick depth + simple project)
   - Phase 1: Frontend & Upload
   - Phase 2: Transcription Backend
   - This avoids over-engineering while maintaining coherent boundaries

2. **Stack Confirmed:** Next.js (frontend + API routes), whisper.cpp binary, tiny/base model

3. **Success Criteria Approach:** Observable user behaviors, not implementation tasks
   - Users interact with upload UI
   - Users see progress feedback
   - Users see transcription results with timestamps

### Todos

- [ ] User reviews and approves ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 planning (frontend scaffold, upload component)
- [ ] Set up Next.js project structure
- [ ] Create upload UI mockup

### Blockers

None — ready to proceed after user approval.

### Assumptions Validated

- whisper.cpp binary is available on user's machine ✓ (from PROJECT.md)
- Next.js is preferred stack ✓ (from constraints)
- Tiny/base model is acceptable for speed ✓ (from key decisions)

## Session Continuity

**Last Action:** Roadmap created from 7 requirements across 3 categories

**What Changed Since Last Session:** Initial state — first roadmap draft

**Ready For:** User approval → Phase 1 planning → Implementation
