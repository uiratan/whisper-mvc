# Milestone v2.1: CI/CD & Docs

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-15
**Phases:** 6-7
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Automated deployment pipeline via GitHub Actions and comprehensive documentation update to reflect v2.0/v2.1 capabilities.

## Phases

### Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline

**Goal**: Automate deployment to Fly.io via GitHub Actions on tag creation
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (complete application)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Create GitHub Actions workflow for tag-triggered deploys

**Details:**
- GitHub Actions workflow triggered by `v*` tag pattern
- Remote Docker builds on Fly.io builders (`--remote-only`)
- Dual health verification: `flyctl status` + HTTP health check
- 30-second stabilization wait before health checks
- FLY_API_TOKEN configured as GitHub repository secret
- Verified with test tag v2.1.0-test

### Phase 7: Documentation

**Goal**: Update README to reflect current system capabilities with screenshots
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (CI/CD pipeline for deployment docs)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Comprehensive README with screenshots and deployment documentation

**Details:**
- README rewritten from ~100 to 242 lines
- 3 UI screenshots (recording, processing, transcription results)
- Complete feature documentation (all input/output methods)
- Local development setup guide with prerequisites
- GitHub Actions deployment workflow documentation
- Privacy & Security section for local AI positioning

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Use --remote-only flag for Fly.io remote Docker builds (faster, no GitHub Actions minutes consumed)
- 30-second stabilization wait before health checks
- Screenshot format JPEG instead of PNG (user-captured files)
- Added Privacy & Security section to README (critical for local AI positioning)

**Issues Resolved:**
- None — both phases executed cleanly

**Issues Deferred:**
- Test automation in pipeline (no significant tests yet)
- Multi-environment deploy (single environment sufficient)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
